        .................. his vessel(?)
        The masters [brought the weapons (?)];
        [bow] and quiver
        They placed in hand.
        [He took] the hatchet.

        [Again] they approached Gish!
        "[How long] till thou returnest to Erech?"
        [Again the elders] approached him.
        [For] the road they counselled Gis:
        "Do [not] rely, O Gish, on thy strength!
        Provide food and save thyself!
        Let Enkidu go before thee.
        He is acquainted with the way, he has trodden the road
        [to] the entrance of the forest.

        [He who goes] in advance will save the companion.
        Provide for his [road] and [save thyself]!
        (May) Shamash [carry out] thy endeavor!
        May he make thy eyes see the prophecy of thy mouth.
        May he track out (for thee) the closed path!
        May he level the road for thy treading!
        May he level the mountain for thy foot!
        During thy night [156] the word that wilt rejoice
        may Lugal-banda convey, and stand by thee
        in thy endeavor!
        Like a youth may he establish thy endeavor!
        In the river of Huwawa as thou plannest,
        wash thy feet!
        Round about thee dig a well!
        May there be pure water constantly for thy libation
        Goblets of water pour out to Shamash!
        [May] Lugal-banda take note of it!"
        [Enkidu] opened his mouth and spoke to Gish:
        "[Since thou art resolved] to take the road.
        Thy heart [be not afraid,] trust to me!
        [Confide] to my hand his dwelling(?)!"
        [on the road to] Huwawa they proceeded.
        ....... command their return
